# Unified 3D Gaussian Splatting for Motion and Defocus Blur Reconstruction

Official implementation of our CAD/Graphics 2025 & Visual Informatics paper.  
[Project Webpage](https://sunbeam-217.github.io/Dual-blur-reconstruction/)




## üîç Method Overview

Our method leverages a unified 3D Gaussian representation to jointly model motion blur and defocus blur across multi-view images. The key contributions include:

- We introduce a dual-blur perception module that generates pixel-level blur masks to explicitly mitigate the impact of motion and defocus blur during 3D reconstruction.
- We design a blur-aware Gaussian splatting process that incorporates blur masks for gradient optimization, ensuring accurate modeling and avoiding degraded information.
- We propose a UGR-Opacity adaptive optimization that refines Gaussian representations in under-optimized blurred regions, improving accuracy and quality.
